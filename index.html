        <h4>Without plane far travelling will be very diffucult.Flying was considered to be an expensive luxury up until the latter part of the 20th Century. Nowadays, it's a relatively affordable mode of travel and prices still continue to drop in some places, thanks in part to larger passenger aircraft and technological advances. In many parts of the world, flying between cities can often be cheaper than travel by rail.</h4>

        <h6>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</h6>
